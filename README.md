# pong
Old school pong remade with the Pygame library in python. This was my final project for Harvardx's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science. 

## pong.py
All of the game's code is contained in this file. 

## Sounds
All of the sounds and songs in the game are originally from the Super Mario 64 and are owned by Nindendo. I retreived them from public sites and do not claim any right to them. They are meant for example purposes only.
